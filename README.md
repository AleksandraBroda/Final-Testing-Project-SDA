# Final-Testing-Project-SDA
This is the final project in the form of presentation that I created and defended for the concluding exam of the Software Tester course at the Software Development Academy.
For the project, I completed the following tasks: 
1. Analysis of Mr.Buggy7 and documentation - familiarizing myself with the technical documentation of the MrBuggy7 project in order to understand and clarify the requirements set in the project, noting inconsistencies, errors, and writing several sample test cases based on the specifications.
2. Project and Product Risk Assessment - document analysis may also include the identification of potential threats, issues, or challenges that may arise during the project.
3. I conducted and documented an exploratory session in the Guru99 Bank test application.
4. I wrote sample test cases in the TestRail tool for the Guru99 Bank Test application, conducted them, and generated a final report.
5. After conducting tests and identifying defects, I wrote a defect report using the JIRA tool.
6. I recorded one test conducted using Selenium IDE.
7. I tested the API documentation for the playground https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html using Postman.
